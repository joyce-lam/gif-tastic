# giftastic

This is a dynamic webpage with gifs themed around Harry Potter. 

There are several buttons with names of characters from Harry Potter. When the user clicks on a button, the page will load 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API onto the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing. The rating for each gif is also obtained from GIPHY API and loaded onto the page below its corresponding gif. 

The user can also add their character of choice in the input box. A button with the name of the character added will be generated and the user can click to load the corresponding gifs.
